In order to understand the difference between a wealthy member of the population and a person belonging to the least wealthy third, we can compare their possessions. One person with a lot of wealth was John Marrott. In the probate inventory, he owned 253 items. One reason he may have owned so much was because he ran an ordinary. An ordinary was “any tavern or inn that served a complete meal at a fixed price,” (Fishbone, 2012).  He purchased a building in January 1708 from John Shields, and soon after got an ordinary license. Marrott later purchased part of the neighboring lot in May of 1708. It seems that Marrott added substantially to the house between 1708 and 1714, because Marrott was “sued for a large carpenter's bill for work on the house,” (Goodwin, 1990). It appears Marrott did not pay the carpenter, Richard King, for his work, as King claimed he was suing for the amount owed for his work. Many items in the inventory would be expected of someone who owned an ordinary, like many beds and chairs. Other of Marrott’s items in the record were more associated with his own wealth instead of the ordinary. This includes a coach, two coach horses, and a coach harness.

Marrott’s operated the ordinary until his death in 1717, and his estate was recorded on January 29th, 1718. Marrott’s death was a tough one, as he was murdered. Francis Sharpe was accused and tried for the murder, and while there are no remaining court records with the verdict, it appears sharp was exonerated since he opened his own ordinary in 1718, (Goodwin, 1990).   
<br />

Let’s compare Marrott with a less wealthy person from the same time period. He is from the least wealthy third of the records. Stephen Besouth only had 21 items in his inventory. Besouth probably lived in Williamsburg several years before he died on April 3rd, 1726. His estate was appraised by John Pasteur, Thomas Dixon and Samuel Cobbs and recorded on July 18th, (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990). Most of his items are associated with his profession, wig making. This includes multiple wigs, horse hair, and bleach. Wigs were worn by people of importance, and local businessmen that came into contact with the public, like possibly Besouth himself, (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990).

Wig making involved taking the measurements of the clients head. The hair then must be cleaned, and colored and lengthened to the request of the customer. The hair also needed to be curled. The hair would be woven together. A wooden head built to the measurements of the customer would be used to mount the wig and sew it to a fabric called a caul. When the sewing is finished, the hair is ironed, dressed, perfumed, etc. (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990).

Wigs were probably in high demand in Williamsburg, so it is curious how Besouth died with so little. It does not seem likely anything was passed down directly to someone, because it appears Besouth either never married, or was a widower. The other possessions he possessed not involved in wig making were simple household things, like cooking equipment and curtains.
