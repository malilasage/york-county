There were some parts of working with the data set and other sources that could be tough to work around. One thing was inconsistencies between sources. For example, we came across three ways of spelling Marrott, or Marrot, or Marot, and that one source says John Camm died in 1779, and two others say 1778. Another thing to work around were the records themselves. There were inconsistencies in spellings, and there were also a few words that we did not know the meaning of. Some things are just plain spelled wrong, like “oen” instead on “one”. An odd thing that caught our attention is that from 1778 onwards, all the records were recorded from the county. There were none from Yorktown or Williamsburg. It is odd that there were none in these two cities, so it makes us wonder if there might be a mistake in the record keeping. Perhaps that is just how it happened.
