“Straw Beds and Silver Plate: How Wealth Evolved in Colonial Virginia” is a research project created as part of the WWU CSCI 197 [Introduction to Digital Humanities](https://github.com/DustinOHara/Intro_Digital_Humanities) class taught by Dustin O'Hara in the fall of 2020. The project looks at how wealth changed in York County Virginia from 1700-1800 by using probate records and other sources.

I am a sophomore at Western Washington University from Thurston County, Washington. I have not decided on a major, but I have been thinking about Anthropology or something else concerning culture, history, and things like that. I took this digital humanities class because I thought it would be a good way to learn and practice skills of collecting data and thinking about visualizations that I might need later on. I enjoyed collecting data and making the maps for this project, and it was interesting to learn how people lived in the past, and seeing individual people’s lives.

I am a sophomore at Western Washington University, and I intend to go into the Computer Science Program. I took this class because I am interested in how programming and technology can overlap with other fields of study. I enjoyed learning about different ways data can be represented and consumed, and the process of creating a digital research project.


**Acknowledgements** <br />
We would like to thank Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell for making the spreadsheet available to use, and we would like to especially thank Wendy for meeting with us and answering our questions and helping find resources. We would like to thank Abby Koehler from the WWU library for helping us with questions and resources. Melissa Schutt from the Rockefeller library and people from the Colonial Williamsburg group were very helpful in providing answers and information.

**Dataset** <br />
Our dataset was compiled by Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell from transcriptions of the original estate records available through the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.

**Record percentages map** <br />
*Tyler Steinberg*

I used esri to make this map. It has tools to outline an area, so I used that and traced along the boundary of York County and of Williamsburg provided on the map. I roughly outlined Yorktown to the best of my knowledge of its borders because it was not outlined on the map. I changed the colors of the region and used the text tool to add the statistics I had gathered earlier.

**Historical events timeline** <br />
*Tyler Steinberg*

I used Storyline by knight lab to make the timeline. I followed the directions it provided on the website, which involved putting the statistics into a Google spreadsheet and describing historical events, before pasting the url of the spreadsheet into the tool. Storyline did the work from there, and provided code to embed the timeline into the website.

**Location map**  <br />
*Tyler Steinberg*

I mostly used Google Drawings to make this map. I first took part of the “Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Williamsburg, Virginia” by Martin Lawrence that I was able to access thanks to the David Rumsey Map Collection. I used Google Drawings to put points on the map that represented the locations of people, and typed a legend. Finally, to make the map look more aesthetically pleasing on the website, I used onlinepngtools to make the white background transparent.

**D3.js Data Visualizations** <br />
*Malila Clearwater*

D3 was used to create the circle animation of the item categories and the diagrams representing the estates of John Marrott and Stephen Besouth. I also used Observable which allows you to use the D3 library in a standalone "notebook" format. It doesn't immediately translate to executable code, but it made it easy to test and prototype visualizations.
