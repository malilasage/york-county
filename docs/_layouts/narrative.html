          For this project we are studying how the standard of living changed over time in York County Virginia from 1700-1800. The main source we are using is probate records from York County from that time period. Probate records record the items of a person who has recently died and then value the items. The people who recorded probate were appraisers and were often the neighbors of the deceased person. The people in probate records were most often wealthy. If they were not wealthy, they are in the records because of some uncertainties about their possessions. The probate records that we are studying are from York County, Virginia, and range from the years 1700 to 1800. There are 694 people in the records. Some of these people may only have one possession, but others can have more than one hundred. York County is on the Virginia Peninsula, flanked by the York River to the north and the James River to the south. The main settlements in the county are Williamsburg, (which is nowadays an independent city, but in the records was included in York County), and Yorktown.

          The years 1700-1800 are significant in this area because of the Revolutionary War and related conflicts, the industrial revolution, and a smallpox epidemic. What we are looking at in the records is the least wealthy third of the people included. We want to if, how, and possibly why the possessions of the least wealthy third in the dataset changed over time. The sources we are using are mainly the essay “Unwritten Rules and Gendered Frames Amongst Probate Appraisers? Evidence From 18th Century York County, Virginia” by Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell. This is an important resource because it uses the same data set that we are using, and they actually made the spreadsheet that we are using, with the extra information that they added. We also interviewed one of the authors of that paper, Wendy Lucas. The other main resource that we are using is the Colonial Williamsburg website and its resources.

          In order to understand the difference between a wealthy member of the population and a person belonging to the least wealthy third, we can compare their possessions. One person with a lot of wealth was John Marrott. In the probate inventory, he owned 253 items. One reason he may have owned so much was because he ran an ordinary. An ordinary was “any tavern or inn that served a complete meal at a fixed price,” (Fishbone, 2012).  He purchased a building in January 1708 from John Shields, and soon after got an ordinary licence. Marriott later purchased part of the neighboring lot in May of 1708. It seems that Marrott added substantially to the house between 1708 and 1714, because Marrott was “sued for a large carpenter's bill for work on the house,” (Goodwin, 1990). It appears Marrott did not pay the carpenter, Richd King, for his work, as King claimed he was suing for the amount owed for his work. Many items in the inventory would be expected of someone who owned an ordinary, like many beds and chairs. Other of Marrott’s items in the record were more associated with his own wealth instead of the ordinary. This includes a coach, two coach horses, and a coach harness. To the best of our knowledge, the coach was appraised

          Marrott’s operated the ordinary until his death in 1717, and his estate was recorded on January 29th, 1718. Marrott’s death was a tough one, as he was murdered. Francis Sharpe was accused and tried for the murder, and while there are no remaining court records with the verdict, it appears sharp was exonerated since he opened his own ordinary in 1718, (Goodwin, 1990).

            Let’s compare Marrott with a less wealthy person from the same time period. He is from the least wealthy third of the records. Stephen Besouth only had 21 items in his inventory. Besouth probably lived in Williamsburg several years before he died on April 3rd, 1726. His estate was appraised by John Pasteur, Thomas Dixon and Samuel Cobbs and recorded on July 18th, (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990). Most of his items are associated with his profession, wig making. This includes multiple wigs, hoarse hair, and bleach. Wigs were worn by people of importance, and local businessmen that came into contact with the public, like possibly Besouth himself, (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990).

          <p>
            Wig making involved taking the measurements of the clients head. The hair then must be cleaned, and colored and lengthened to the request of the customer. The hair also needed to be curled. The hair would be woven together. A wooden head built to the measurements of the customer would be used to mount the wig and sew it to a fabric called a caul. When the sewing is finished, the hair is ironed, dressed, perfumed, etc. (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990).
          </p>
          <p>
            Wigs were probably in high demand in Williamsburg, so it is curious how Besouth died with so little. It does not seem likely anything was passed down directly to someone, because it appears Besouth either never married, or was a widower. The other possessions he possessed not involved in wig making were simple household things, like cooking equipment and curtains.

            A wealthy person who lived later in the century was Reverend John Cramm. He was president of the local William and Mary College. Camm first assumed the role temporarily when the acting president of the college,James Horrocks, traveled to England on June 21st, 1771, (William & Mary Libraries 2019). Horrocks died on his way to England on March 20th, 1772, and Camm was officially elected William and Mary’s seventh president in July 1772 by the Board of Visitors. Camm stayed in this role until Spring 1777 when he was ousted by the Board of Visitors due to ‘neglect and misconduct”, and Camm died in his birth county of England in 1778, (William & Mary Libraries 2019)..Before his stint as president of the college, he was a professor at William and Mary from 1749-1957 and 1763-1771, and he was elected to the governor's council in 1772, (Looney 2016). The fact he was on the governor's council also points to his status, as “the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men” (Tarter, 2019)

            He had 102 items listed in the probate records, with a combined value of about £19,760.24 in 1779. According to CPI Inflation Calculator, that would be £3,460,301.84 today or $4,622,617.23 in 2020. This included several slaves and farm animals, like pigs and cows. He also owned prints by William Hograth who was an English printmaker, and several pieces of walnut furniture. The furniture and art pieces are not really necessary and show that he had wealth to spend on items that some other people couldn't afford. A farmer in Vermont made (adjusted for inflation) $9.50 with board, (Adams 1939). Just one of Camm’s Walnut tables was valued at $482.53; and he had five of them.

            A person in the bottom third of wealth in the same time period was Matthew Davenport. He too, interestingly enough, was also associated with William and Mary College. He served as a writing master in 1766. Other positions he had were Deputy Clerk of York County which he was appointed to in 1773, Town Clerk in 1775, and Clerk of Hustings Court in 1777, which was the year he died, (Stephenson 1990). He left no will which is the reason he has his estate filed. Davenport had 54 items listed in the document, most of which were basic things, like napkins, an old clock, a teapot, and quilts. He also had six slaves. They could be the slaves or the descendants of the slaves his father gave to him his father’s will:

        This chart shows the estimated financial value of John Marrott's estate at the time of his death. The value is broken down into categories, followed by the cost of the individual items. The ownership of slaves and silver plate signify his economic status as a wealthy member of York County. Some possessions may have been left out of the inventory by the appraisers, as it was common practice to omit some items for the use of the deceased's widow.

          The main literature that is important for us to look at is the “Unwritten Rules and Gendered Frames Amongst Probate Appraisers? Evidence From 18th Century York County, Virginia” by Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell, as it uses the same data set. In their essay they use the probate records to see if there was a gender bias in the appraisal process. They ended up coming to the conclusion that gender does in fact influence the accuracy of estate records. They also point out that there are problems and inconsistencies in the data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this project we hope to provide readers with important insights into the time period. It would be interesting for readers to compare what the lesser had then and compare it to what they have today. It can be compared to how the standard of living has changed in just the past 50 years, showing how fast things are moving. We also have not come across any projects with this data set like the one that we are doing, so it is significant that we are doing something that has not been widely looked at before. Finally, we want to identify problems and inconsistencies with the probate records and process, so that the same mistakes can be avoided nowadays.

          As they approached the 18th century, colonial settlers focused on establishing farms and land. Given the high mortality rate and the lack of locally produced consumer goods, they often did not have time or means to expand their material comforts. Typical houses at the time were comprised of one or two rooms, occupying 320 square feet, and constructed entirely of wood. These houses were easy and cheap to construct but were not built to last more than 20-25 years. (Horn, 1988) The small size of rural dwellings meant that living and working spaces were intermixed, and the overall standard of living in colonial Virginia was considerably worse than their native England.
        </p>

          Starting in 1715, the wealthy began to acquire material goods that distinguished them from the poor and middle class. Possessions no longer needed to be multi-purpose, and an increase in the available living area meant items could be increasingly specialized to their task (such as a writing desk in an office, rather than a single table used for all household activities).

          By the 1750s, settlers who didn't belong to the economic elite could start to prioritize items outside of basic household equipment, though for them it meant purchasing individual chairs and cutlery, bedsteads, and ceramic tableware. Those who lived in town focused their new spending on possessions that could facilitate social activity, such as gaming tables and tea services. (Walsh, 1983)

          Our dataset includes several item categories, created to assist in the analysis of the inventories. The categories include items necessary for basic survival (something to cook with, a bed, a chest or trunk, and something to sit on), and categories associated with gender. The inventories are also broken down by wealth into thirds, with the top third representing those with estates valued at £8,000 and above, the middle representing £1,838 to £7,999, and the bottom representing £43 to £1836. Though inventories were not taken for every person in York County, we believe this is still a large enough spread to be useful. Research done by Carr and Walsh, using probate records from the same time and geographic area, includes additional categories such as indoor lighting, timekeeping, and decorative items, to better represent possessions tied to wealth and social status.

            Settlers possessed basic household equipment (bed, cooking pots, something to eat off, a chest or two, and a gun for hunting) and usually went without items such as chairs, tables, bedsteads, sheets, and interior lighting. In wealthy families, members could sit on individual chairs and eat from separate bowls. The differences in what the wealthy and the lower class owned were few, but the wealthy could afford to own more and higher quality items.
