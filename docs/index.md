## Intro
For this project we are studying how the standard of living changed over time in York County Virginia from 1700-1800. The main source we are using is probate records from York County from that time period. Probate records record the items of a person who has recently died and then value the items. The people who recorded probate were appraisers and were often the neighbors of the deceased person. The people in probate records were most often wealthy. If they were not wealthy, they are in the records because of some uncertainties about their possessions. The probate records that we are studying are from York County, Virginia, and range from the years 1700 to 1800. There are 694 people in the records. Some of these people may only have one possession, but others can have more than one hundred. York County is on the Virginia Peninsula, flanked by the York River to the north and the James River to the south. The main settlements in the county are Williamsburg, (which is nowadays an independent city, but in the records was included in York County), and Yorktown.

The years 1700-1800 are significant in this area because of the Revolutionary War and related conflicts, the industrial revolution, and a smallpox epidemic. What we are looking at in the records is the least wealthy third of the people included. We want to if, how, and possibly why the possessions of the least wealthy third in the dataset changed over time. The sources we are using are mainly the essay “Unwritten Rules and Gendered Frames Amongst Probate Appraisers? Evidence From 18th Century York County, Virginia” by Wendy Lucas and Noel Campbell. This is an important resource because it uses the same data set that we are using, and they actually made the spreadsheet that we are using, with the extra information that they added. We also interviewed one of the authors of that paper, Wendy Lucas. The other main resource that we are using is the Colonial Williamsburg website and its resources.

## Context

In order to understand the difference between a wealthy member of the population and a person belonging to the least wealthy third, we can compare their possessions. One person with a lot of wealth was John Marrott. In the probate inventory, he owned 253 items. One reason he may have owned so much was because he ran an ordinary. An ordinary was “any tavern or inn that served a complete meal at a fixed price,” (Fishbone, 2012).  He purchased a building in January 1708 from John Shields, and soon after got an ordinary license. Marrott later purchased part of the neighboring lot in May of 1708. It seems that Marrott added substantially to the house between 1708 and 1714, because Marrott was “sued for a large carpenter's bill for work on the house,” (Goodwin, 1990). It appears Marrott did not pay the carpenter, Richard King, for his work, as King claimed he was suing for the amount owed for his work. Many items in the inventory would be expected of someone who owned an ordinary, like many beds and chairs. Other of Marrott’s items in the record were more associated with his own wealth instead of the ordinary. This includes a coach, two coach horses, and a coach harness.

Marrott’s operated the ordinary until his death in 1717, and his estate was recorded on January 29th, 1718. Marrott’s death was a tough one, as he was murdered. Francis Sharpe was accused and tried for the murder, and while there are no remaining court records with the verdict, it appears sharp was exonerated since he opened his own ordinary in 1718, (Goodwin, 1990).

Let’s compare Marrott with a less wealthy person from the same time period. He is from the least wealthy third of the records. Stephen Besouth only had 21 items in his inventory. Besouth probably lived in Williamsburg several years before he died on April 3rd, 1726. His estate was appraised by John Pasteur, Thomas Dixon and Samuel Cobbs and recorded on July 18th, (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990). Most of his items are associated with his profession, wig making. This includes multiple wigs, horse hair, and bleach. Wigs were worn by people of importance, and local businessmen that came into contact with the public, like possibly Besouth himself, (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990).

Wig making involved taking the measurements of the clients head. The hair then must be cleaned, and colored and lengthened to the request of the customer. The hair also needed to be curled. The hair would be woven together. A wooden head built to the measurements of the customer would be used to mount the wig and sew it to a fabric called a caul. When the sewing is finished, the hair is ironed, dressed, perfumed, etc. (Thomas and Tonkin, 1990).

Wigs were probably in high demand in Williamsburg, so it is curious how Besouth died with so little. It does not seem likely anything was passed down directly to someone, because it appears Besouth either never married, or was a widower. The other possessions he possessed not involved in wig making were simple household things, like cooking equipment and curtains.

## Changing Material Comforts

As they approached the 18th century, colonial settlers focused on establishing farms and land. Given the high mortality rate and the lack of locally produced consumer goods, they often did not have time or means to expand their material comforts. Typical houses at the time were comprised of one or two rooms, occupying 320 square feet, and constructed entirely of wood. These houses were easy and cheap to construct but were not built to last more than 20-25 years. (Horn, 1988) The small size of rural dwellings meant that living and working spaces were intermixed, and the overall standard of living in colonial Virginia was considerably worse than their native England. Settlers possessed basic household equipment (bed, cooking pots, something to eat off, a chest or two, and a gun for hunting) and usually went without items such as chairs, tables, bedsteads, sheets, and interior lighting. In wealthy families, members could sit on individual chairs and eat from separate bowls. The differences in what the wealthy and the lower class owned were few, but the wealthy could afford to own more and higher quality items.

Starting in 1715, the wealthy began to acquire material goods that distinguished them from the poor and middle class. Possessions no longer needed to be multi-purpose, and an increase in the available living area meant items could be increasingly specialized to their task (such as a writing desk in an office, rather than a single table used for all household activities).

By the 1750s, settlers who didn't belong to the economic elite could start to prioritize items outside of basic household equipment, though for them it meant purchasing individual chairs and cutlery, bedsteads, and ceramic tableware. Those who lived in town focused their new spending on possessions that could facilitate social activity, such as gaming tables and tea services. (Walsh, 1983)
